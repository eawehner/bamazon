BAMAZON - A storefront for those who just can never leave Terminal!

# What is Bamazon?
Bamazon is a CLI-based storefront that may or may not have been inspired by a certain, larger web-based storefront of a similar name! Some assembly is required as you'll need to set up your own MySQL database. Fortunately for you, we've included a scheme.sql file with some dummy data to get you started!

**Important**: After setting up your MySQL, don't forget to change the necessary settings in the bamazonCustomer.js file! You can't log into a database without your username and password after all! We also set the default port as 3306, so make sure to adjust that setting if you need to make any changes.

## Using Bamazon as a customer

Once you've gotten Bamazon setup (as the MySQL database creator, NPM installer and Node.js champion that you are!), you'll see all the available items in stock. The most important bit of information for you, of course, is the price and stock quantity.

You'll be prompted to select the item you'll want to buy by ID, as well as the amount you'll like! If there's enough of your item in stock then you'll be given a total and your (imaginary) items will be on their (imaginary) way to your (presumably, imaginary) way!

Next time you boot up the program, you'll be able to notice the dent you've made in the availably of Light-Up Pikachus worldwide!

## Is that all?
For the time being yes, but in the future there will similar programs for those wishing to manage and supervise their own stores! Look forward to it!
